Classic arcade game of pong for two players written by myself using python code and python turtle module.
Player on the left can move up and down using 'w' and 's'.
Player on the right hand side moves up using 'Up arrow' and down using 'Down arrow'.
If the ball touches one of the player's paddle or hits the wall it bounces changing it's diretion on the axis y or x depending on type of collision.
When the ball reaches the end of screen on right or left it means one of the players gets additional point, which will be then presented on the scoreboard.
After scoring, the ball will be automatically reinstated to its initial position and the game will continue until one of the players scores 8 points.

                                                                    IMPORTANT! 
Unfortunately turtle module does not support using multiple buttons at the same exact time, so if one of the players keeps the key presses, the other one cannot move :(
